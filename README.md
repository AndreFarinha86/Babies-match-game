## Testing

Along the development of the project regular testing were carried out. And the pages were reloaded several times after each addition and modification.


1. This website is responsive to all screens sizes down to 280px wide and was tested by using the devtools device toolbar for different devices.

2. The navigation buttons were tested and all work well.

3. Modals were tested and all work well and are responsive to different screen sizes.

4. All game leves were tested and all work well, cards are flipping, keep revealed if it matches and hide if it doesn't, moves are increasing with each flipped card and time is counting down. Gameover Modal is popping when time is finished before all cards are revealed and win modal is popping when all card are revealed before time is finished. When the reset button is clicked, moves will reset to zero, revealed cards will be hidden, and time will reset to initial.
